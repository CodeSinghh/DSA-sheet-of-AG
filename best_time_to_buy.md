Sure! Here's the code documentation written in a paragraph format:

This code provides a solution to calculate the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying and selling stocks. The `maxProfit` function takes a vector `prices` as input, which contains the prices of stocks over time. It returns the maximum profit that can be obtained.

The function begins by checking the size of the `prices` vector. If it is empty, indicating no stock prices are available, the function returns 0, as there is no opportunity for profit.

Next, the function searches for the smallest number in the `prices` vector and keeps track of its index. It iterates through the vector, starting from the second element, and updates the `smallest` and `smallestIndex` variables whenever a smaller price is found. This is done to identify the minimum price to buy the stock.

If the `smallestIndex` is equal to the last index of the vector (`n - 1`), it means the smallest price is already at the end of the vector, implying no opportunity for profit. In this case, the function returns 0.

To calculate the maximum profit, a new vector called `newPrices` is created. It contains the elements of the `prices` vector starting from the `smallestIndex` to the end. This vector represents the stock prices from the point of purchase onwards.

The function then proceeds to find the smallest and largest numbers in the `newPrices` vector. It initializes `newSmallest` and `newLargest` with the first element of `newPrices` and iterates through the vector, updating these variables if a smaller or larger price is found, respectively. These values represent the minimum and maximum prices among the purchased stocks.

Finally, the function returns the difference between `newLargest` and `newSmallest`, representing the maximum profit that can be obtained by buying at the lowest price and selling at the highest price within the given stock prices.

The provided example in the `main()` function demonstrates the usage of this code by creating a vector `prices` with sample stock prices. It creates an instance of the `Solution` class, calls the `maxProfit` function with the `prices` vector, and prints the resulting maximum profit to the console.
